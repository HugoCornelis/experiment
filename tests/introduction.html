    <h1>Functional Tests for the Experiment software component</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the Experiment
    software component.  The tests consist mainly of running single
    executables with a hardcoded model, and checking the generated
    output.  See the SSP package for integration tests with other
    Neurospaces and G-3 software components.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of what stimulation
      paradigms the Experiment software component offers.  The level
      of testing is functional, ie. user experienced functionality
      (ie. no low-level unit tests).
